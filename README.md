# GeoTwitter2020

GeoTwitter is an iOS application based off of Twitter's available reverse geocodable data. It can pinpoint the city from where the tweet was tweeted and display it on a map.
Some basic features from Twitter are also included,
* Authentication via Twitter
* Direct messages
* New tweet
* Trending hashtags
* Tweet search with a keyword
* Profile page

The application was developed with sprints, each lasting for four days with a total of four sprints completed.
The project also included a week long design sprint, weekly team meetings, personal daily diary, user tests, documentation and a final product presentation.
